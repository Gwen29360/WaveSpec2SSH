# WaveSpec2SSH
### Description
This repository contains Python tools to invert wave spectra into a synthetic wave field. The inverted wave field looks realistic but does not reproduce many wave processes such as wave breaking. In the src.py, the user will find some spectral transformations that may be useful for other applications/dataset.

The test-data are available here: 'https://thredds.cdip.ucsd.edu/thredds/dodsC/cdip/archive/029p1/029p1_historic.nc?waveTime[0:1:405410],waveHs[0:1:405410],waveFrequency[0:1:63],waveEnergyDensity[0:1:405410][0:1:63]


### Dependencies
WaveSpec2SSH requires the following dependencies: Xarray, Numpy, Maplotlib, Scipy, time
