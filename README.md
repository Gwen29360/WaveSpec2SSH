# WaveSpec2SSH
### Description
This repository contains Python tools to invert wave spectrum to a synthetic wave field

The test-data are available here: 'https://thredds.cdip.ucsd.edu/thredds/dodsC/cdip/archive/029p1/029p1_historic.nc?waveTime[0:1:405410],waveHs[0:1:405410],waveFrequency[0:1:63],waveEnergyDensity[0:1:405410][0:1:63]
The inverted wave field looks realistic but does not reproduce many wave processes such as wave breaking.

### Dependencies
WaveSpec2SSH requires the following dependencies: Xarray, Numpy, Maplotlib, Scipy, time
